Gov.UK Discourse Theme
======================

This theme uses the Gov.UK frontend library to style the forum following the GDS design system.

It will add the standard header and footer, allowing to customise the header Product name.
It will override discourse's styles.

If you install it and there are components not styled, raise an issue and we'll see if we can fix the issue.
